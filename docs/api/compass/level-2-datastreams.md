# CoMPASS Level 2 - Data Streams

Functions for computing reward-contextual features for Level 2 cognitive state inference.

## Overview

This module provides utilities to compute:

- KDE-based proximity to target zone
- Angular deviation from reward path
- Euclidean distance to target
- Value-based distance measures
- Reference orientation information

These features are combined with Level 1 states to infer goal-directed cognitive states.
